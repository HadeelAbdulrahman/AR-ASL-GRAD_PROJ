# 🤟 Real-Time Sign Language Translation & Learning System

*A dual-function AI-powered platform that translates sign language in real time and teaches sign language interactively — designed to bridge the communication gap between signers and non-signers.*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **AI-powered real-time sign language translator and educational system** that recognizes:

* **American Sign Language (ASL)**
* **Arabic Sign Language (ArSL)**

from **live video input**, and converts gestures into:

* 📄 **Written text**
* 🔊 **Synthesized speech**

In addition, the system includes an **interactive learning module** that provides **instant AI-based feedback** and **gamified progress tracking**, helping users learn sign language effectively and enjoyably.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* 🎯 Achieve **>90% gesture recognition accuracy**
* ⚡ Maintain **real-time performance (< 500 ms latency)**
* 🌍 Support **ASL and ArSL**
* 🔊 Provide **text-to-speech output**
* 🖥️ Deliver an **intuitive and accessible UI**
* 🧩 Build a **scalable and modular architecture**
